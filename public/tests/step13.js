/*
  In Step 13, you'll lay the foundation for our upcoming `audio-player`
  component.

  Because our component is named `audio-player`, the first step is to create
  a template named `components/audio-player`.

  Also, define an `Ember.Component` subclass named `App.AudioPlayerComponent`.
  This class will allow you to add JavaScript behavior to the dynamic tag.
  The component should have the class "audio-control".

  Once that's done, use the newly-created `{{audio-player}}` tag to put the
  audio component in the `nowPlaying` template, inside the "now-playing-player"
  <div> that we had previously left empty.

  For now, just put a placeholder <audio> tag inside the
  `components/audio-player` template. We'll make it work in the next step.
